# CertificatePinningExamples
Sample projects for playing with different certificate pinning techniques in Android. In each project,
the first 500 characters of a target domain HTML page is fetched. There are two tests: one for the success
of pinning and one for the failure. In case PIN is correct, the page content is shown and otherwise an error
is shown. Each project has a separate README file that further explains the tecnhique and the details.
